# HID-IO Protocol Spec

Unlike the KLL spec which puts some very heavy processing/resource requirements on the MCU, the goal HID-IO is to fit on the smallest of keyboard/input device firmwares while still maintaining very high OS compatibility. Virtually all the commands will be optional, and the supported commands are defined by the keyboard at runtime.

## Summary

HID-IO is an input device sideband protocol specification designed to give additional functionality and control to input devices beyond what is available using HID interfaces (e.g. USB, Bluetooth). The intent is to have another sort of driver/program/daemon run on the host computer which can communicate directly with the keyboard over the given interface. Some notable features this will enable would be to output UTF-8 symbols, change-locales on the fly, host side defined macros and on-screen keyboard layout views. Special consideration has been given to make sure that HID-IO will not be turned into a sort of keylogger interface without the user being aware.

Each command is prefaced with an Id. All Ids are reserved, this means that a firmware designer would need to request Ids for custom commands if the standard set of commands are not sufficient. The possible number of Ids is large enough such that it should not need to be extended, but allows for small packet sizes.

The layout of the protocol, and designated interface(s) have been chosen to simplify firmware design so it may fit in smaller MCUs. Nearly all Ids are optional which allows the firmware designer to pick and choose the relevant ones for their particular keyboard or save precious flash and ram on the MCU.

This is not an ultra-low latency interface, it's meant to complement the USB HID interrupt endpoints.


## Scope

When USB was developed in the mid-90s, one of the goals was to expand the possibilities of external devices and still use a signal interface. And to this end, they succeeded. We no longer have PS/2 ports (for keyboards and mice), game ports, parallel ports and serial ports (still around, but not nearly as pervasive) because USB can take care of all these different interfaces even all of them over the same cable. Without going into too much detail, USB defines descriptors programmed into the devices that specifies what sort of data will be transmitted/received and what it will look like. The various USB specs go into great detail about all the variations possible and which ones require drivers and which ones should have host side drivers built-in (e.g. USB HID).

However, the problem comes when you want to add something that is not supported within the USB HID spec. In order to propose an addition you need to be a member of USB-IF ($$$$) and get your changes approved by the committee. Then on top of that you need to either implement the driver or wait until the relevant OSs and devices support the USB HID additions. And to top it all off, the new USB HID spec still won't work on older computers and devices. Needless to say, the effort/time:reward is pretty low when you're looking to extend the capabilities of a keyboard beyond what the USB HID spec defines them to be.

Instead, the spec proposes a very simple sideband protocol that input devices can use **and** extend with a relatively quick approval process without requiring any sort of financial remuneration (i.e. it's free).


## Interface

**Note**: Bluetooth and other interfaces are TBD until a full OS compatibility evaluation is done.

**Note2**: USB Raw HID is currently being evaluated to determine if it will suit hid-io better going into the future. Raw HID is supported on Bluetooth which is partially the reason to move away from a USB Vendor Specific Interface.

In order to communicate between the host and the device an interface is needed.

On USB this means some sort of descriptor is required to open up a communication pipe. Ideally, we would be able to use a special provision in HID called Raw HID. Raw HID is just a couple USB interrupt endpoints (Tx and Rx) that supports sending fixed sized data packets. In terms of data rate, minimal descriptor and code size, this would be an ideal interface to use. On Windows Raw HID is even driver-less. For Linux [hidapi](https://github.com/signal11/hidapi) exists, and while it's not well maintained anymore it should provide a good interface to hidraw. On macOS hidapi uses IOHidManager which may work well, but since macOS changes the driver stack often it may be necessary to maintain a macOS driver.

```
|Interrupt Max Packet Sizes|
Low Speed - 8 byte
Full Speed - 64 bytes or less
Hi-Speed - 1024 bytes or less (this also applies to 3.1 Gen 1 and 2)
```


### Raw HID

Since Full Speed USB 2.0 is the most common usage on keyboards, we shall start with 64 byte packets.
Going to larger packet sizes is rather easy, but going too large would slow down the bus and would really only be necessary if lots of data were being transmitted.
If it's found that a lot of data needs to be transmitted (and USB 2.0 high-speed is available), then the packet size can be re-visited or a 2nd interface can be created for large transmission sizes.

In order to identify that a specific device interface is available to client side software. We'll be using three interface descriptor fields.

* Usage Page (0xFF1C) - Read as FFK
* Usage (0x1100) - Read as II 0

PJRC [recommends](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/cores/blob/1.53/teensy3/usb_desc.h#L612) that the Usage Page be between 0xFF00 and 0xFFFF and the Usage be between 0x0100 and 0xFFFF.
In section 3 of the [HID Usage Page Table](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/documents/hut1_12v2.pdf#page=14) 0xFF00 to 0xFFFF are listed as Vendor-defined and are safe to use.
It is still not apparent why the Usage should be greater than 0x0100, but it is likely for OS compatibility reasons.


### Vendor Specific (deprecated)

**Note:** The reason for not using a Vendor Specific interface is to simplify Windows driver integration (which is painful). And make sure that there is a minimum permissions level such that random applications cannot attach to the HID-IO interface and build keyloggers directly.

A good (and similar) alternative is called a Vendor Specific interface which I'll refer from now on as Raw IO. Raw IO defines two interrupt transfer endpoints, Rx and Tx, and a given max packet size. This is very similar to Raw HID, but has the added bonus of not requiring a driver on Mac or Linux. Windows requires a WinUSB/libusb shim driver (what the [zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) loader is for) unfortunately, but no reboot is required and this part can be automated due to the client side software also needing to be installed. Utilizing libusb (or similar) generic drivers the client side code base can be dramatically simplified. The max packet size may be set to whatever is ideal for the input device and still adheres to the USB spec. For Full-speed USB 2.0 this is a maximum of 64 bytes.

In order to identify that a specific device interface is available to client side software. We'll be using three interface descriptor fields.

* bInterfaceClass (0xFF)
* bInterfaceSubClass (0x49)
* bInterfaceProtocol (0x4F)

According to the USB spec, to use the Vendor Specific/Raw IO interface **bInterfaceClass** must be set to [0xFF](https://www.usb.org/defined-class-codes#anchor_BaseClassFFh). While both **bInterfaceSubClass** and **bInterfaceProtocol** may be set to any value. Most Vendor Specific interfaces set all 3 values to 0xFF, so to differentiate against these devices HID-IO requires 0x49 (ASCII I) and 0x4F (ASCII O) be set.
Any versioning will be done using the spec protocol, so it shouldn't be necessary to add any more subclass and protocol values.

For more reliable host side USB device keying, it is recommended that the host program to locate at least 1 USB HID interface first, before looking for the Raw IO interface.


## Protocol

The idea behind this protocol is to simplify device side processing and not imposing a command limit. This is to encourage its use on a wide variety of input devices. The underlying interface (e.g. USB) takes care of error detection and packet re-transmission so there are no additional provisions for detecting errors (would increase the load on the MCU). For this reason it is not recommended to use the HID-IO protocol on wire level interfaces such as UART/RS-232, I2C and SPI without additional error correction/re-transmission packet framing.

__Requirements of transmission__
* One packet per medium packet (e.g. USB), no packet bundling. This makes synchronization easy if either side gets into a bad state.
* Every data packet must be responded by an Ack or Nak packet.
* Each side periodically (~1-5 seconds) sends Sync packets as a keep-alive. If more than one Sync is received while waiting for an Ack or Nak the previous data packet was not successfully processed. Sync packets should only be sent if the device/host has not sent a packet during a given time interval.
* If a request is received while sending its own query, finish sending the query, then immediately process the request. Do not send a Sync between unless sending a packet using the max payload. In this case a Sync packet should be sent immediately after to tell the receiver that the packet will not be continued.
* When receiving a Nak packet, any pending continued packets for that sequence must be dropped. Nak packet may, or may not contain a payload. No payload indicates that the request is not suported.
* No acknowledement packets (Data and Continued) are used when no response is needed. This is to facilitate lower latency communication such as keypresses or debug message data.


**Packet Types**

HID-IO has a 7 different packet types: Data **b000**, Acknowledge **b001**, Negative Acknowledge **b002**, Sync **b003**, Continued **b004** packets, No Acknowledgement Data **b005** and No Acknowledgement Continued **b006**. Packets label 7 is reserved. These 3 bits are included in the Header byte of each packet.

```
VVVW XYZZ
VVV - Packet type
  W - Continued
  X - Id width
  Y - Reserved
 ZZ - Upper length bits

0110 0000 (0x60) - Sync packet

|Packet Types|
b000 - Data
b001 - Acknowledge
b010 - Negative Acknowledge
b011 - Sync
b100 - Continued
b101 - No Acknowledgement Data
b110 - No Acknowledgement Continued
b111 is Reserved

|Continued|
b0 - All data payload fits into one packet
b1 - An additional continued packet is necessary
(last packet sets to b0 to indicate complete)

|Id Widths|
b0 - 16 bit
b1 - 32 bit

|Upper Length Bits|
b11 1111 1111 - 1023
b00 0000 0001 - 1
```

Except for the Sync packet, which only requires a single byte transmission, the rest of the packets require at least two more pieces of information: Length and Id. Length is the number of payload bytes left in the packet while Id is the unique identifier to specify each command/response. The length byte is always after the header byte.

The length field is a value between 1 and `<max packet size>` - 2. In addition to the dedicated byte, this field has 3 additional bits from the Header byte which are the MSBs. This 10 bit number (max 1023) is sufficiently large to handle any interrupt max packet length as defined by the USB spec (as of writing). It is the responsibility of the sender to make sure the length value does not exceed the max packet size as USB does not have automatic chunking available for this type of interface. When the continued bit is set (W=1), then the length field represents the number of packets that are pending for the continued packet. A packet with W=1 always contains a maximum payload.

All payloads are Id specific and may include any sort of data without restriction as long as it fits within the max payload size. If the payload is larger, the payload may be chunked into Continued packets. The receiving side will need to keep track of the previous packet type to process the continued packet.

The Id Width field indicates whether the Id is 16 bits or 32 bits wide. As long as the Id is lower than 2^16, a 16 bit field is always supported. Only use 32 bit Ids when required, not all firmwares will support 32 bit Ids.

When in doubt, data is in Little-Endian format.

## IDs

Each HID-IO command has a unique Id associated with it. To future-proof, HID-IO supports up to 32 bit Id values.

While most of the Ids are optionally implemented, there are a few that are required so that both the device and the host can gather information about the other.

The next sections will use the following format.

#### Direct Set
```
0x26 <starting byte address:16 bits> <data>...

Directly sets the devices buffer.
This is very device (and likely configuration) specific.
However, this is the simplest form of LED control and does not require any special handling or drivers on the device side.
Latency wise, this is the fastest way to set pixels as it should be a straight copy to the LED buffer.
If the data buffer is smaller than the destination, do not change the unset buffers.
The device may decide to override what is set (a device specific configuration may be required to disable this behaviour).

If the buffer is too large for the destination a NAK will be returned (unless using no ack packets) and the buffer will not be set.
If the device is not configured for direct set (or pixel set), a NAK is returned.

#### Open URL
```
0x30 <utf-8 url>

Opens the given URL (e.g. https://, file://, etc.) with the OS default application.
Most commonly used to open the web-browser to the specified URL.

+> (No payload)
-> (No payload)
  NAKs if failed to open successfully (no application found).

#### HID Keyboard State
```
0x40 <keyboard hid code bitmask 32 bytes long, 0-255>
0x40 <LSB>...<MSB>

This message, while longer than needed for a 6KRO keyboard message, does not lose any information when passing around NKRO keyboard messages.
For example, to encode A + B (which is 0x04 and 0x05):

0x04 + 0x05 == b0011_0000 (count right to left)
       0x06 == b0100_0000 ...
       0x09 == b0000_0000 b0000_0010 ...

+> (No payload)
-> (No payload)
```

#### HID Keyboard LED State
```
0x41 <keyboard led hid code bitmask 1 byte>

This is the standard HID keyboard LED bitmask.

0x1 == b0000_0001 == NumLock
0x2 == b0000_0010 == CapsLock
0x3 == b0000_0100 == ScrollLock
0x4 == b0000_1000 == Compose
0x5 == b0001_0000 == Kana

### Manufacturing Test
```
0x50 <command:16 bits> <argument:16 bits>

Various test commands used during manufacturing to validate the hardware.
 * 0x0001 - LED test sequence
            Generally cycles through all available colors to check for dead LEDs.
            Args:
            * 0x0000 - Disable
            * 0x0001 - Enable
            * 0x0002 - Activate LED short test (see 0x51 for result)
            * 0x0003 - Activate LED open circuit test (see 0x51 for result)

 * 0x0002 - LED cycle on keypress test
            Used with shake tests to determine if there are hair-trigger switches.
            On each press or release event, cycle to a different LED event.
            Args:
            * 0x0000 - Disable
            * 0x0001 - Enable
 * 0x0003 - Hall Effect sensor test
            Used to check the status of each sensor.
            Args:
            * 0x0000 - Disable all
            * 0x0001 - Pass/Fail test (toggle)
            * 0x0002 - Level check (toggle)

Any return values will be sent as a Manufacturing Test Result (0x51).
